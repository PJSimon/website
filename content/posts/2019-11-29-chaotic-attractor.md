## Pickover's Chaotic Attractor
![](../thumbnails/Chaos1.png)

Here is my latest software art project: An implementation in JavaScript (ES6) of Clifford A. Pickover's classic chaotic attractor. [Try it here](https://chaosvue.netlify.com).  Watch as a beautiful picture, one that no one has ever seen before, fades slowly into view.

The image is generated by computing a histogram of the points visited in the image by continuously iterating a chaotic attractor in the browser's background.

Definition:
```
xn+1 = sin(b*yn) + c sin(b*xn)
yn+1 = sin(a*xn) + d cos(a*yn)
```
where a, b, c, d are variables that define each attractor.
For each new image the four variables are chosen at random. Next the point (x,y) is updated to a new point (xn, yn). This point in the image is made one point darker or lighter on a scale of [0, 255] = [pure black,  pure white]. The pixels are iterated continuously in this manner until 10% of the pixels touched have reached the maximum (or minimum) value.
#### Implementation Notes
I first saw images of Pickovers's chaotic attractor almost 30 years ago when I bought his book [Computers, pattern, chaos, and beauty: Graphics from an unseen world](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Computers%2C+Pattern%2C+Chaos+and+Beauty+%3A+Graphics+from+an+Unseen+World).
In 1996 I implemented Pickover's chaotic attractor in C++ on an IBM PC to help me learn Windows 95 graphics and application programming. I shared the .exe file with several friends on 3.5" floppy disks. They enjoyed it.
Recently I was looking for a simple project to help me learn the [Vue.js](https:www.vuejs.org) framework and JavaScript bitmap programming. So I decided to implement it once again, this time as a web project using Vue.js. I am really enjoying the Vue.js framework, and the associated development environment. The best part is that now I can share my art project with the masses instead of with just a few friends.  If you enjoy [this art project](https://chaosvue/netlify.com) please help me grow the audience by sharing this link.

If you have questions, or suggestions, or bug reports please don't hesitate to contact me.  Also let me know if you are interested in seeing the source code for this project.
