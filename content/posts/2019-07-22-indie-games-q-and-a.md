# Answers to questions from the excellent book about indie development: *[Indie Games: From Dream to Delivery](https://www.amazon.com/Indie-Games-Delivery-Don-Daglow/dp/0996781552/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3OVXIIS6BB3XU&keywords=indie+games+from+dream+to+delivery&qid=1563912409&s=gateway&sprefix=Indie+Games+from%2Caps%2C187&sr=8-2)* by Don L. Daglow


### QUESTION 1.1
### What is the game that you have been thinking of creating that inspired you to read this book?
*I am going tp do a updated version of Worms? called Darworms.*
### What objective would you like to meet by launching your indie game?
* *I would like as many people as possible to play the game.*
* *I would the game to run on as many devices as possible*
* *I would like to use this projet to learn modern web development techniques*
* *I want to do this as a Software Artist, in other words I want this to be an individual rather than a team effort*
* *I do not want to be responsible for monitoring and maining a server.  No Pager Duty for me!*
* *It would like to at least cover my direct expenses through some form of monetization.  These costs should be minimal, hopefully under $100 per month.*
* *Possibly parlay this project into other other opportunities: blog, speaking engagements, articles.*
* *I want to open source the source code for the game and let others learn from the code and extend the code*

### QUESTION 1.2
### What makes you passionate about this game?
* *Its uniqueness.  It is a pure strategy game, with no hand or eye coordination, and yet a novice always stands a decent beating an experienced player.*
* *I know from experience that this game will NOT appeal to most people because it is too abstract, but a decent subset of people will find it fascinating and love it.  I believe it will once again collect a small but dedicated cult following.*

### When did you first become interested in the play style, genre, category or theme that lies at the core of the game you want to create?
*Scientific American Mathematical Games column by Martin Gardner.  Conway's game of Life, Pattersons Worms. Core Wars.*

### What was the first game you played in this genre that made you love the category?
 *Conway's Game of Life*
### QUESTION 1.3
### What is the first platform on which you plan to release your game?
*Desktop Web Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari.*
### What other platform do you intend to support simultaneously, or soon after you initial launch?
*Mobile Web Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari.*
### Will your game require any additional hardware or peripheral for users to play, like VR headsets or alternate interface devices?
*No, only and internet connected modern browser.*
### QUESTION 1.4
### In what programming language (or languages) will your came be coded?
*ECMAScript 6, ES6*
### Will you use a third party engine as the foundation for your game, or create it entirely from scratch?
*The game is 2D, and uses the HTML 5 canvas API for the graphics.   The user interface uses JQuery Mobile which is built upon JQuery.  The game uses the Web Audio API for audio*
### If you're using an engine, will it be Unity 2D or 3D? The Unreal Engine? CryEngin? GameMaker?  Something else?
*HTML5 Cannvas API and JQuery Mobile.*
### QUESTION 1.5
### Is this your first game of this scale?
*No.*
### Have you pursued lots of indie games in your life?
*Only Worms? commercially.  I have written some other games while learning systems at various employers. I have worked on many many games as a Technical Director at Electronic Arts.*
### Have you worked on other initiatives or startups that were similar in size to this project?
*Yes. I originally developed Worms? in Forth and 6502 assembly language natively on an Atari 800.*
### QUESTION 1.6
### Dreams change as we live our lives. What is a game you once really hoped to create, but that is no longer as important to you?
*I wanted to create a networked space shooter game in which each  opponent appears as a kind of quantum probability cloud, based on the latency of that player's connection to the server.*
### QUESTION 1.7
### What game do you think you may want to build in a few years from now that isn't as important to you today?
*I would like to do a 3D simulation of darwinian genetics and evolution.*
### Why will you care more about it in a few years than you do now?
*I foresee 3D modeling and 3D tool chains getting easier to make this feasible as a one person piece of software art.*
### QUESTION 1.8
### Do you have ideas for additional content or follow up products than can be introduced if your first game is a success?
* *Play real time over the internet.*
* *Genetic Algorithms to breed Darworms*
* *Server to store Darworms and set up matches for internet play*

### QUESTION 1.9
### Is it the technology involved in the making of the game that interests you?
Is it the genre or category of the game? The platform on which you'll release the original version? The style of interface? Or do you take joy in the visuals of the game? The audio? Some combination of the above choices?
*It is really a combination of all of the above choices.  I wanted to learn JavaScript, especially ES6. I am fascinated by the possibility of zero friction installation of web based games.  The visuals and audio also bring joy.*
### QUESTION 1.10
### What makes you believe that this game will draw player's attention in a crowded market?
*Past game reviewers have praised it*
*  *"The fact that you can rio off some other worm's territory just by being the last one to lay a trail in it gives Worms? all the strategic fascination of ancient games like Go and chess. Combine that with the fact that all the sound effects are keyed by particular movements of each worm, and you've got an aesthetic extravaganza of a game." Electronic Fun Magazine, September 1983*
* *"Worms? is intellectually stimulating, beautiful to watch and soothing to hear. The entire gaming experience is transcendental, the patterns are hypnotic. Worms? is vastly different from any other computer game I've ever seen."  Run Magazine May 1984*
* *"Worms? is a strange game in a lot of ways. Even though it consists of lines and dots, you can easily be drawn into the game's world.  Some arcade games do this with cute characters and elaborate animation. Neither of these are used in Worms?. Yet you **do**  *fall into the worm's mentality quickly, thinking about how to train your worm faster, or on better patterns. Worms? is almost impossible to imagine without seeing it on the screen and experiencing the game."  Computer Gazette Magazine June 1984*
* *".. (Worms?) is a skill game, that is unique, engaging, and delightful. The game holds a lasting and nearly hypnotic fascination. There is something compelling about the intricacies of pattern - from the fugues of Bach to the mosaics of the Alhambra - that makes humans rejoice. The game Worms? combines harmonies of patterns in an extremely original and diverting way, and is good for hours of experimentation. Then challenge the world!" Creative Computing, September 1983.*

### Is this a completely new idea, or are you setting out to improve a game that already exists?
*I am improving a game that has existed but really doesn't exist today.  There are at least of couple of generations that have never seen not heard of it.  I am improving the game by adding lots of user controllable settings, such as game s
### QUESTION 1.11
### If you could describe your indie game to a stranger in just one sentence that would interest him or her, what would that sentence be?
*You program a synthetic creature, a darworm, to crawl around a hex grid in a territory capture game against other computer or human controlled darworms.*
### What are the three most important features that will make someone want to play your game and spend money on the title?
*Unique game play, interesting visuals and audio, free web based game play.*
### QUESTION 1.12
### What is the primary mood of your game? (e.g. happy, dark, frightening, goofy, stealthy, forboding, curious, joyful etc.)
*curious and joyful.*
### What is the pace of your game? (e.g. frenetic, thoughtful, alternating action and strategy, etc)
*thoughtful and strategic. Hand-eye coordination and quick reflexes are not needed*
### How long will people play in a typical session, and where will they be playing? For two minutes waiting in line at the grocery store? Fifteen minutes on the bus? Three hours in the living room?
*All of the above.*
### one of the first people to play your game has lunch with a friend. What do they say to the friend about how they were feeling as they played?
*Interested, curious, delighted in discoveries
### QUESTION 1.13
### What will the first two minutes of the player experience be like in your game?
*Confusing. What is this and how does it work?  Describing the game in words is notoroiusly difficult but after playing for a couple of minutes it becomes obvious*
### Will you have a tutorial? How will users learn to plays?
*I have a pop-up window tutorial that tries to help with this problem.  I am not sure if it helps enough.  However two minutes of experimentation should be enough*
### QUESTION 1.14
### What will the first playable prototype of your game include?
*I have already almost completed the first 1.0 feature complete version.  It includes four players (locally on one shared screen). It includes five types of Darworms: New, Same, Smart, Random and Sleeping.  It includes many user settable options including agme speed, grid size, grid geometry. It also includes options for each darworm including the instrument sample to use and the musical scale to use for that darworm.   It also includes saving games to local web storage for replay and aldo includes the ability to email a game to a friend.  It does **NOT** *any network play nor user identity, nor server login.*
### QUESTION 1.15
### What kind of people will wan to play your game?
*I think William Micheal Brown said it best in his September 1983 review in Electronic Fun Magazine: "Now I've never met Mr. Maynard, but after playing Worms? for about 20 hours, I can tell you that he has probably the most original, refreshing, and seriously weird imagination of any game designer today.  What do I mean by 'seriously weird'? Well basically this is a game right out of 'Steppenwolf: Magic Theatre - Not for Everyone,' There are no ramps to climb, no Invaders to fry, no Gorfs or Defenders or death-dealing wizards here. Nut if you are tired of those game cliches and want something that really used the potential of your computer: if you are fanatic for the turf-stealing subtleties of Go, if geometry was your favorite subject in because you liked the pictures, or if your single most fvorite magazine column was Martin Gardner's 'Mathematical Games' in Scientific American - then my friend prepare yourself for a diet of Worms?.*
### What other games do these people play?
*Chess, Go, Stratego, Strategy games in general*
### What websites do they visit?
*I don't really know.  I suspect science or math related sites. Programming sites.  Github, Stack Overflow.  Medium.com. Strategy games.  Brilliant.org  Discovery Channel *
### Where would you find them on social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc?
*Facebook groups related to science, mathematics, programming, strategy games. Game development groups.  Game company alumni groups. Specific Facebook groups:*
* *Atari Museum*
* *Game Development*
* *Retro Gaming 101*
* *Indie Games*
* *Indie Game Promo*

### What games are the most similar to your indie title?
*I really can't think of many similar games.  Conway's Game of Life, and Core Wars.  One reviewer called Worms? not a game, but a software toy*
### How is yours different? What makes yours better?
*My game, Darworms, is unique*
### QUESTION 1.17
### How would you feel if The New York Times, Wired Magazine, Oprah Winfrey and your best friend's mother all said your games sucks?
*I would be ecstatic that my game had received so wide a mention because I know that a certain segment of the population will find it fascinating*
### You just won a mega-million-dollar jackpot in the lottery! You've cleared your to-do list and taken a 3-month vacation at a series of your favorite cities and resorts.
### You return happy, rested and all caught up in every phase of your life. There's no to-do list for work, and nothing at home that needs to be cleaned, straightened, fixed, watered, painted, re-arranged or put away.
### You no longer need to work, nor does your spouse or partner. If you have kids, however, they still attend the same grade of school and they still have to do their homework. Some things can't be changed by money!
### From this moment on you can do whatever you want to do each day. In this "perfect world" how would you spend the first month when you get back?
*I have basically been doing this since I retired in May of 2017. Here are the things I do:*

* *Improve my juggling skills*
* *Improve my touch typing skills*
* *Hike, shop and garden with my wife*
* *Play Zynga Poker: I have accumulated over 45B $ in funny money without ever buying a single chip.  Texas-Hold'em is a wonderful game design.

*It was both, but mainly the people.*
### QUESTION 2.14
### What is the best-organized company you've ever worked for?  What did they do that made you feel that way?
*Xerox P.A.R.C. was amazing.  Small teams, research funded by a Corporate, no immediate product responsibilities. Management was all scientists and researchers.  So much innovation in an amazing short period of time.  Graphical UI, Laser Printers, Ethernet,
Unicode.  Not surprisingly, when the research was spun-off to the Xerox System Development Division with a charter to productize and commercialize the technology, the management became much worse and the product (Xerox Star) was a complete failure.  The product was ahead of its time, and too expensive and yet still under-powered for mass adoption.*
### Where did you work in your career thus far where people got the most done each day, week, month, and year? What was it that made the team so productive?
*Xerox P.A.R.C. where as a five person team we built the world's first WYSIWYG Japanese Word Processor on the Alto computer.  We had to build tools to create out own bitmap fonts.  One display font took more memory than the Alto had (32kb). We got a patent for an algorithm that made one pass through the display-font disk file, bltting each character onto all the positions on the screen in which it occurred.  This guaranteed that the display time was bounded by the time it took for one pass over the disk file. The small team size, great project manager, and incredibly talented team members made the team super productive.*
### QUESTION 2.15
### Regardless of how efficiently the team worked, and regardless of how much you enjoyed the process, what is the project you've worked on in your career where you were most proud of the game?
*Modem Wars.*
### What was it about that game that made you feel so proud?
*The technology of multi-player gaming over a 300 baud modem in 1985.  Danny's design was brilliant, the technology worked, and the result was unmatched pure joy in the game
play.*
### QUESTION 2.16
### How would you feel if you never went back to your current work environment again?
*Already done that! Retired two years ago.*

*Yes.  I try to stay in touch with those I became close to.*
### Are there other perks or activities involved in your current work that you'd be sad to lose?
*Yes. I miss the free lunches*
### QUESTION 2.17
### What other parts of your life would bring you joy if you could just magically make them go away?  Some of these may seem obvious (the IRS?), but writing them down sill helps you organize your thoughts.
*The IRS. Housework, home maintenance, health issues.*
### What other parts of your life would bring you anguish if they were suddenly taken away (e.g. your family, your church, close friends, places you like to go, activities you enjoy etc.)?
*My family. My ability to exercise and hike. My grandkids. My internet connection. My close friends*
