I am a computer scientist recently retired from a fascinating career of riding the leading edge wave of several computer revolutions in Silicon Valley.

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in Computer Science in 1969, thee second year that degree was offered at Berkeley.
 I have had a wonderful career as a software engineer and manager in Silicon Valley.  I have been in the right places at the right times to watch and participate in the computer revolutions. I have had the opportunity to work in some truly remarkable organizations with some some amazingly talented and visionary people.  I am creating this blog in order to record some of my experiences during this journey, and as the journey continues through retirement.


I plan to record in this blog some of the Silicon Valley history I have witnessed
